### Tanks! CE

A clone of Tanks! from Wii Play for the TI-84 Plus CE.
I do not own the copyrights for Wii Play.
If you really think that this version will somehow take away profits from a console and game that are no longer being sold, leave an issue or something (but go after Oiram first :P).

Developed using the [CE C Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain)
The [C libraries](https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest) are required to run this program. 
You'll also have to compile it yourself at this point in time, as it is too unstable for me to keep uploading releases.
Also once you do that you still shouldn't expect anything to happen because I haven't done anything yet.
